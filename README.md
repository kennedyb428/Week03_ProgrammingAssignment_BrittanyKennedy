This C++ program helps vegetarian weightlifters plan and evaluate their nutrition. It generates personalized insights based on user input — including daily calorie targets, number of meals, and weekly workout hours — and provides basic nutrition advice to support their training goals.

The program features an menu system implemented with a switch statement, allowing users to choose between viewing daily breakdowns, generating a printable report with a weekly breakdown, or receiving personalized advice. The nutrition advice option uses structured if/else statements and predefined thresholds to offer guidance based on calorie intake and activity level.

Key Features:

  1. User-friendly menu navigation powered by a switch structure
  2. Input validation to prevent crashes from invalid entries
  3. Default values applied automatically for invalid or missing input
  4. Daily macro calculations displayed directly in the console
  5. Daily and weekly summaries exported to a report file
  6. Personalized nutrition feedback based on calories vs. activity level
